'''In mulitple linear regression, we actually don't need to apply feature scaling, because accroding to the function of the 
multiple linear regression, we have the coefficients that multipled to each independent variable, therefore, it doesn't matter
if some feature have higher values than other.'''

'''We don't need check the linear assumption before we apply dataset to linear model. We can just evaluate the model preform.
if its proform poorly, we just switch to other models.'''

'''We don't need to worry about the select the features that have the highest P-value. Because Multiple Linear Regression model
will automatically identify the best features, the features that have the highest P values or that are the most statistically 
significant to figure out how to predict the dependent variable.'''
